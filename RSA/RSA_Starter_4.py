# the private key d in RSA is the modular multiplicative inverse of the exponent e modulo the totient of N
# that mean, in this challenge, e*d congruent with 1 mod N
# modular multiplicative inverse is when given a, x and m, we have a*x congruent with 1 mod m
# so that, x is the mod inverse of a (mod m)
# we can use Extended Euclidean algorithm to solve or use pow() function
